###  Your one stop shop for GoT character lore
Game of Thrones Glossary is a rather simple website designed to give GoT fans the expierence of searching any character from the show and be provided information; while also being able to search entire list of members of each house / family.
> ..also enjoy the soundtracks as you browse to get the full effect 😏😃

## User Stories
User is able to filter Game of Thrones character by family house, gives user list and description of each member of specific house. User is able to individualy search for a specific character and is returned charcter description detail upon clicking "More Info" button.


## Deliverables
> As a user, I can:
* Select character by specific family, displaying all family members
* Individual character look-up with expandable character details

## Stretch Deliverables
* User is able to select through GoT soundtrack
* User can select through characters via keydown event to move through different characters without having to use search-bar.
* User is able to view best quotes from each character.
* User is able to customize site background to _great house_ logos

## Event Listeners
> These are 3 of the event listeners in use.
* 'change' - When the 'change' event is triggered, an anonymous function is executed. Inside this function, this refers to the select element that triggered the event
* 'click' - When 'click' event is triggered the user can either trigger it by clicking "More Info" to display more info on character card or by clicking "Find Character" to find specific character.
* 'keydown' - When user types into search for character bar, user presses 'enter key' 'keydown' as listener to complete search.

## Array Iteration
> This is how we will use array iteration
* '.forEach' - used to display each family in our house filter dropdown to be able to select each house / family name.
* '.map' - used for mapping a new array that contains only the family names of each character.
